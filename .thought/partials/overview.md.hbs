This small library is a promise-library agnostic function that resolves a whole structure
or objects, arrays, promises and values to a single promise in which the whole structure is 
resolved.

Unlike other libraries like {{npm 'q-deep'}}, {{npm 'resolve-deep'}} and 
{{npm 'swear'}}, this library is designed to work without dependencies to any promise library
(and also without any other dependencies).
Just pass the promise constructor (i.e. `Q.Promise` or `Promise`) as first argument.

**Note: There is no cycle check. You have to check for cycles yourself before passing the
  structure to the function**
